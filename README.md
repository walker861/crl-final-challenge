Final challenge solution to Kevin Powell's Conquering Responsive Layouts course

I have been utilizing many sources to learn the fundamental of using HTML and CSS. I started the journy with The Odin Project and found Kevin Powell's YouTube channel as a result of completing those projects. After a seeing several videos, I ended up exploring Kevin's Website and found the free course Conquering Responsive Layouts. This is the final challenge of the course. I am working through JavaScript in The Odin Project and FreeCodeCamp now. Hopefully, I will be able to add some interaction in the near future as I learn more about how to use JavaScript in web development. 
To anyone else out there who is struggling with responsive layouts, Kevin Powell is an excellent resource. This course has helped me tremendously. I'm looking forward to continued learning and exploration in the world of web development. Happy Coding!
